                    <p>Hello again!ðŸ˜Ž Thanks for scrolling this far!! Yes as you already know I am a frontend web developer, I started my coding journey about two years ago and I'm grateful for how far I've come and enthusiastic about the future. 
                    Other than coding, I am currently a student of the University of Lagos, Nigeria majoring in Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. I enjoy lots of music and movies, also feel free to reach out to me with book recommendations (doesn't necessarily have to be about coding).
                    </p>
